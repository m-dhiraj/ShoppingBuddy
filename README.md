# React Webapp

###Inspiration
We wanted to make something that could help bring the community together to help disabled and elderly people during this time when it is necessary to be social distancing. With this app, we wanted to give these people the opportunity to help others who are more susceptible to the virus’s negative effects and cannot risk going outside.

###What it does
ShoppingBuddy matches volunteers to the recipients (who are disabled or elderly people) who are in need of groceries or amenities.

###How we built it
We utilized a React Library of JavaScript and CSS with a Node.js framework. We utilized a Google Maps API and the public Kroger API to match volunteers to the nearest grocery stores with the largest amount of specified items. Additionally, we used Firebase to handle authentication (log in) and storage of verified users and grocery list.

###Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using React, so learning how to design pages, make button, and route to different places took time for us to learn. Getting your current location on Google Maps and displaying a track with your location, the store, and the and destination, as well as incorporating the public Kroger API was a struggle for us. Lastly, as it was our first time using Firebase, we learned how to incorporate this backend feature for authentication and storing grocery items.

###Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to build an simple, yet intuitive web application that helps people in a time of crisis (especially now).

###What we learned
React, Node.js, Firebase, and pulling from the Google Maps and the public Kroger API.

###What's next for ShoppingBuddy
+Communication : our clients will be able to send texts and call their “Shopping Buddy”, in the case that they want to change their order or confirm their arrival
+Verified Users : users will have to have a “verified” status in order to deliver, to ensure quality of delivery for the recipient
+Big Company Sponsors : we will obtain partnerships with rideshare companies (who may be running out of business given the crisis) in order to bring their audience and increase the scope of publicity
+More Companies! : given our limited current selection of grocery stores, we hope to expand our database to include a wider range of places to choose from
